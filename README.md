# Assorted thoughts on Aaron's single-cell software

## Overview

This repository contains a number of thoughts I've collected on single-cell data analysis.
I've written up these thoughts here to avoid forgetting them.
Why a Github repository?
Because it's difficult to publish minor updates to software;
it's not appropriate to put in-depth theoretical descriptions in the in-package documentation;
and blog posts only encourage needless self-aggrandizement.

## Organization

My thoughts are organized into three directories:

- `general`: general thoughts on single-cell data analysis, not specific to my own software.
- `scran`: thoughts on [_scran_](https://github.com/MarioniLab/scran) functions, with focus on justifying some of my programming choices.
- `simpleSingleCell`: thoughts on the [_simpleSingleCell_](https://github.com/MarioniLab/simpleSingleCell) workflow, again focusing on justifying some of the parameter choices.
This also contains the expected results of the workflow, to make it easier for me to check the results.

## Reader's note

The writings in this repository contain my internal opinions and should be treated as such.
The only reason that this is public is to make it easier for me to get its content from computers that are not my own.
Don't send me materials to add - or God forbid, suggest "corrections"; I will close any issues and PRs, and delete any e-mails on this matter.
If you want to change my mind... well, you'll have to change my mind.
