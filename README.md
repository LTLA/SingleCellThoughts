# Assorted thoughts on Aaron's single-cell software

This repository contains a number of thoughts I've collected on my single-cell software.
Roughly speaking, it is organized into three directories:

- `general`: general thoughts on single-cell data analysis
- `scran`: thoughts on [_scran_](https://github.com/MarioniLab) functions, with focus on justifying some of my programming choices.
- `simpleSingleCell`: thoughts on the [_simpleSingleCell_](https://github.com/MarioniLab/BiocWorkflow2016) workflow, again focusing on justifying some of the parameter choices.

I've put these thoughts here as it is difficult to publish minor updates to software.
Moreover, it is not appropriate to put in-depth theoretical descriptions in the in-package documentation.
