# Assorted thoughts on Aaron's single-cell software

This repository contains a number of thoughts I've collected on my single-cell software.
I've put these thoughts here as it is difficult to publish minor updates to software.
Moreover, it is not appropriate to put in-depth theoretical descriptions in the in-package documentation.

Roughly speaking, my thoughts are organized into three directories:

- `general`: general thoughts on single-cell data analysis, not specific to my own software.
- `scran`: thoughts on [_scran_](https://github.com/MarioniLab) functions, with focus on justifying some of my programming choices.
   Perhaps there is an opportunity for a pun with the current repository name (e.g., "food for thought").
- `simpleSingleCell`: thoughts on the [_simpleSingleCell_](https://github.com/MarioniLab/BiocWorkflow2016) workflow, again focusing on justifying some of the parameter choices.
  This also contains the expected results of the workflow, to make it easier for me to check the results.
