title: "Aaron's single-cell thoughts"
---

A collection of thoughts related to single-cell data analysis, mostly for RNA sequencing.
These are split into three broad categories:

- **general**: broad thoughts about practices in single-cell data analysis, not specific to my own software.
- **software**: justifications for some of the programming choices used in my own scRNA-seq data analysis software.
- **workflow**: justifications for some of the parameter choices and strategies in my scRNA-seq analysis workflows.
